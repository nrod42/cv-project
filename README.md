App that generates a resume based on user form inputs. Users are then able to download the generated resume as a PDF.

## Functionality

The user is presented with specific forms on each page of the site and all forms feature some kind of form validation. Users can make multiple entries in sections where that is relevant. If needed, users can also edit any entry from any section at any time. Once the user reaches the final review page, they can generate a PDF of their resume for download.

## Reflection

This was the first project I made using React. My first iteration was completed using class components, as a way to learn how to use them. I learned all about the basics of React like, state, props, and the lifecycle methods. I ended up re-creating everything using functional components where I learned all about Hooks like useState, useEffect, and useContext.

I was initially switching between sections by simply hiding and displaying each one as neededHowever, once I learned about react router, I immediately came back and implemented it in this project which reduced the amount code and styling.

As for the styling, I originally used custom CSS but ultimately I ended up using Bootstrap. I had never used Bootstrap up until this point but I decided it was a good opportunity to learn how to use it.

Overall, this project was an amazing opportunity to learn all of the basics of React.
