# Resume Builder

App that generates a resume based on user form inputs. Users are then able to download the generated resume as a PDF.

## Functionality

The user is presented with specific forms on each page of the site and all forms feature some kind of form validation. Users can make multiple entries in sections where that is relevant. If needed, users can also edit any entry from any section at any time. Once the user reaches the final review page, they can generate a PDF of their resume for download.

## Reflection

This was the first project I made using React. While my first iteration was completed using class components (as a way to learn how to use them), I ended up re-creating everything using functional components. I learned all about the basic of React like, state, props, and the lifecycle methods. Once I started using functional components, I learned and used Hooks like, useState, useEffect, and useContext. After I learned how to use react router, I came back and incorporated it in this project as well.

As for the styling, I originally used custom CSS but ultimately I ended up using Bootstrap. I had never used Bootstrap up until this point but I decided it was a good opportunity to learn how to use it.

Overall, this project was an amazing opportunity to learn all of the basics of React.
